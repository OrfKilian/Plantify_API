# Plantify API

This repository contains the Plantify project including a Flask backend and static frontend files. The dashboard already integrates a temperature history chart for each room.

The chart is rendered in `templates/dashboard.html` using Chart.js and the values are loaded from the API in `static/dashboard.js`.
